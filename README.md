This is a small game created during the covid lockdown to experiment with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).

This project can be reused for educational purpose and to experiment with NEAT. Use main.py to start the game.


You can change the parameters in the config file (neatbot > confcovid.txt) and in game.py.

The project was created by Simon Roy, student at Ã‰TS.
